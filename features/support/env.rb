  # Capybara defaults to XPath selectors rather than Webrat's default of CSS3. In

  # By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
  # to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
  # your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
  # be rendered instead.
  #
  # Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
  # exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
  # Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
  # There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
  #
  # 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
  #
  # 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
  # recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
  #
  # ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false

  # Remove this line if your app doesn't have a database.
  # For some databases (like MongoDB and CouchDB) you may need to use :truncation instead.

    # Loading more in this block will cause your tests to run faster. However,

    # need to restart spork for it take effect.

# --- Instructions ---
# Sort the contents of this file into a Spork.prefork and a Spork.each_run
# block.
#
# The Spork.prefork block is run only once when the spork server is started.
# You typically want to place most of your (slow) initializer code in here, in
# particular, require'ing any 3rd-party gems that you don't normally modify
# during development.
#
# The Spork.each_run block is run each time you run your specs.  In case you
# need to load files that tend to change during development, require them here.
# With Rails, your application modules are loaded automatically, so sometimes
# this block can remain empty.
#
# Note: You can modify files loaded *from* the Spork.each_run block without
# restarting the spork server.  However, this file itself will not be reloaded,
# so if you change any of the code inside the each_run block, you still need to
# restart the server.  In general, if you have non-trivial code in this file,
# it's advisable to move it into a separate file so you can easily edit it
# without restarting spork.  (For example, with RSpec, you could move
# non-trivial code into a file spec/support/my_helper.rb, making sure that the
# spec/support/* files are require'd from inside the each_run block.)
#
# Any code that is left outside the two blocks will be run during preforking
# *and* during each_run -- that's probably not what you want.
#
# These instructions should self-destruct in 10 seconds.  If they don't, feel
# free to delete them.




# TL;DR: YOU SHOULD DELETE THIS FILE

# This file iwas generated by Cucumber-Rails and is only here to get you a head start
# These step definitions are thin wrappers around the Capybara/Webrat API that lets you
# visit pages, interact with widgets and make assertions about page content.
#
# If you use these step definitions as basis for your features you will quickly end up
# with features that are:
#
# * Hard to maintain
# * Verbose to read
#
# A much better approach is to write your own higher level step definitions, following
# the advice in the following blog posts:
