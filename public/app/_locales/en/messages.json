    "description":"Wheelmap is an application for wheelchair users, for people with walking frames or pushchairs.

    Which underground stations are equipped with a lift? Are there accessible restaurants, cafes or clubs around you? Which museums or libraries are accessible for people with limited mobility and which are not?

    With Wheelmap, all users can find, enter and modify accessible and less accessible locations on a virtual map. With the search mask you can also find worldwide locations - for example to plan a journey. 

    Wheelmap is based on OpenStreetMap and works similar to wikipedia - everyone can contribute to improving the accumulated data. All data is always up to date.

    Note:
    - to look for locations or to modify the accessibility status of an existing location, no registration is required
    - if you want to enter the accessibility status of a new location you need an account for wheelmap.org and the OpenStreetMap. Both accounts must be linked in your profile on wheelmap.org.

    Wheelmap was developed by the non-profit organisation SOZIALHELDEN.The SOZIALHELDEN's aim is to adress social challenges with innovative approaches."
